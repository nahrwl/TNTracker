{"name":"TNTracker","tagline":"A bukkit plugin for logging the placement of certain blocks.","body":"###Welcome to techietotoro's TNTracker project page!\r\n\r\nTNTracker is a bukkit plugin for tracking and logging the placement of certain blocks by players. Owners of small Minecraft servers sometimes want to track certain blocks, such as TNT, to make sure all the server rules are being followed. This is just a small plugin I created for a server I contribute to.\r\n\r\nTNTracker logs block placements of flagged blocks (Currently only TNT and non-configurable) in the console and in a separate log file.\r\n\r\nTwo commands are supported to add and remove flagged blocks: /tracker add, and /tracker remove.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
